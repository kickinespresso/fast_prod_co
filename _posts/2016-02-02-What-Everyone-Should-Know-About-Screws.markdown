When it comes to selecting the right fastening devices for successful completion of a project, there are many factors to consider. However, once you have determined that screws are the best choice for the job, you will need to decide which type of screws will best serve your needs. Not only are there a number of screw sets available on the market, but each type of screw serves its own unique purpose. [Screws](http://www.fastprodco.com/) shouldn't be mysterious; here are a few things that everyone should know about them. 

Socket set screws and socket cap screws are designed for use with a socket wrench. Users should realize that there are a number of sizes and shapes when it comes to socket wrenches, so it's important to select the right one for the job. Also important is to make sure you have the correct socket to fit the screws that you wish to use.

Slotted set screws, square head set screws, and machine screws are a few examples of the many different types of screws. Each type of screw serves a unique purpose. Whether you're looking to complete a home project or hoping to put together your own creative invention, there is certainly no shortage of screws from which to choose.

When you are selecting your screws, whether you choose slotted, hex socket, square head, or any other set screws, you can rest assured that you'll find the right fit to complete the task at hand.

## Picking the Right Screw for the Job

In the past, picking a screw led you to two main options--Phillips and slotted. With advances in materials and fasteners, today's options are limitless.  So, how do you choose the best screw for your project?  Let's look at a few options and discuss the different fastening possibilities.

### Head of the Screw
For most past projects, the Phillips was the go to fastener of choice primarily because you would have been using a hand-held screw driver, but in today's cordless world the technology has advanced enough to help prevent screw head slippage and other options have become available. If the project is more decorative, then brass screws may be best; or maybe security is a requirement for the task so you will need to purchase star drive heads. You can even find screws with painted heads if the project needs to blend in.  Whatever the choice, be sure to take note of this on the front end before you acquire the wrong screw.

### Job of the Screw
Is the job indoors or outdoors? Is it a metal or wood project? Differences in jobs can greatly affect the performance of the screw. Be sure to understand what is expected of the screw when determining which one to pick. A sheet rock screw is designed to cut into the wood quickly without splintering, while wood screws are designed to pull two pieces of wood firmly together. If the job is outdoors you will need corrosion resistant screws such as stainless steel or silicon-coated. Less expensive, zinc coated screws or other coatings are acceptable indoors, where corrosion or weather isn't a factor.


### Size of the Screw

Depending on the job, the size and length of the screw will vary.  As a general rule of thumb the screw should size should be 2 to 3 times as thick as the material you are trying to fasten. In other words, a piece of 1/4 inch wood should be fastened with a 1/2 or 3/4 inch long screw to hold it in place. Of course, the orientation of the joining pieces as well as the type of fit will become factors in screw type. Screws come in many gauges, so your project will dictate what type you need. If working with wood, #6 is typically the best small screw size for the application, and #12 would be the largest.

Many other factors may come into play, and a simple project can easily become overwhelming.

## Some Tips on How to Properly Use Stud Fasteners

Whether you're building a house, or a car engine, knowing [how to properly use a stud fastener](http://www.fastprodco.com/) can come in handy. Let's go over a couple of quick tips about them, shall we?

* Studs tend to work better than bolts, in some cases, due to their ability to distribute stress in a more equalized manner.
* You have your choice of studs: with a bottom "nose," or without a bottom "nose." Depending on your job, you may want to be careful when using a stud without the "nose." If you go to insert the stud into your material, and find that it leans slightly to the side once you've screwed it in (just finger-tight), you may end up with a weakened hold after you the washer and nut go on. Screwing on the washer and nut will straighten the stud up, but the pressure and stress being applied can wear on its ability to make a lasting, secure hold.
Now that we've talked about a couple of tips, let's take a look at a quick two-step how-to guide for using the stud fasteners:
* After you have inserted the stud into your material (just using your fingers), place the washer on the end of the stud. Once the washer is on, add a bit of lube to the top of the washer and to the threads on the stud. Then, place the nut on top of the washer and finger-tighten.
* Once you have the nut tightened to the point of meeting slight resistance, use your torque wrench to finish the tightening. By tightening things this way, you avoid any rotation with your stud, and thereby gain a more even torque load. More even torque loads mean longer lasting, more secure holds.
